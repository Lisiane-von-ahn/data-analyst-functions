    "# Notebook Title: Database Insertion Functions for PostgreSQL\n",
    "T\n",
    "This notebook contains Python functions used to insert data into a PostgreSQL database. The functions are designed to automate the insertion of different entities (sites, formations, and modules) into respective database tables. The goal is to handle large folder structures, identify key elements, and populate the database efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions work together to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Normalize and format the data before inserting it.\n",
    "    Check if the record already exists in the database before adding new entries.\n",
    "    Handle errors and ensure that the database connection is managed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python libraries and modules are used in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    psycopg2: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python to handle database connections and queries.\n",
    "        Install it using: pip install psycopg2\n",
    "    os: A standard Python library for interacting with the file system to traverse directories.\n",
    "    connection: A custom module to establish a connection with the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "    util.common: A custom module for utility functions like normaliserModule and formaterModule used to standardize the module names before insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Step 1: insert_module\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Inserts a new module into the modules table in the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "    Procedure:\n",
    "        Normalize the module name: Standardize the format of the module name before inserting it.\n",
    "        Database check: Queries the database to see if the module already exists.\n",
    "        Insert if needed: Inserts the module if it doesn't already exist in the table.\n",
    "        Error handling: Rolls back the transaction if an error occurs and closes the database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: insert_formation\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Inserts a new formation into the formations table in the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "    Procedure:\n",
    "        Database connection: Establish a connection to the database.\n",
    "        Check for formation: Queries the database to see if the formation already exists.\n",
    "        Insert formation: If the formation doesnâ€™t exist, it's inserted into the table.\n",
    "        Commit changes: The transaction is committed to the database.\n",
    "        Error handling: Handles errors and closes the database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: insert_sites_formations_modules\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Recursively traverses a folder structure to identify and insert sites, formations, and modules into the database.\n",
    "    Procedure:\n",
    "        Directory verification: Ensures the base folder exists and is a directory.\n",
    "        Site traversal: Iterates through site folders and calls insert_formation to add formations.\n",
    "        Formation traversal: For each site, it navigates into the formations, adding them to the database.\n",
    "        Module insertion: Once the formations are added, the function dives deeper into each formation's subfolders to insert modules using insert_module.\n",
    "        Completion: All relevant data from the folder structure is inserted into the database."
