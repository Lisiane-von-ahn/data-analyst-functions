## Data Analyst Functions Repository
- Project Overview

This repository is a collaborative project showcasing various data analysis functions developed by participants during the Data Analyst training at the Campus Num√©rique in the Alps. Each contributor will add their own Jupyter notebooks containing functions that exemplify skills in data manipulation, database interaction, and analysis techniques.
Objectives

    To demonstrate the practical application of data analysis techniques learned during training.
    To create a comprehensive collection of useful functions for data analysis in Python.
    To foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among colleagues.

- Structure

The repository will contain:

    Individual Jupyter notebooks for each contributor.
    Functions categorized by their purpose (e.g., database operations, data manipulation, visualization, etc.).
    Documentation within each notebook explaining the functions and their usage.

- Libraries Used

This project utilizes a variety of Python libraries, including but not limited to:

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: For numerical operations.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
    psycopg2: For PostgreSQL database interaction.
    os: For operating system interactions.

- Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

2. Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Install the required libraries using:

bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn psycopg2

3. Create Your Notebook

Each contributor should create their own Jupyter notebook and follow these steps:

    Name your notebook descriptively (e.g., data_visualization_functions.ipynb).
    Add your functions and include clear documentation for each.
    Organize your functions logically, grouping related functionalities together.

4. Commit Your Changes

After adding your notebook, commit your changes:

bash

git add your_notebook.ipynb
git commit -m "Add data visualization functions"
git push origin main  # or your working branch
